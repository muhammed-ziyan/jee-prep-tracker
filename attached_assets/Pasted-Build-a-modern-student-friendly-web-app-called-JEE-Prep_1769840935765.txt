Build a modern, student-friendly web app called JEE Preparation Tracker (stack: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Supabase) with a clean “mobile-first” feel and simple navigation (bottom nav on mobile, sidebar on desktop). The app should revolve around an always-useful Dashboard that shows today’s snapshot and month-wise progress: study hours, questions solved, syllabus completion by subject, revision due count, backlog count, upcoming schedule items, mock test trends, and gamification widgets (streak, XP/level, badges). The UI should feel lightweight and motivating: quick actions (“Log today”, “Add revision”, “Add task”, “Add mock”) and charts that are readable at a glance.

Create a Syllabus section designed for JEE Main official syllabus mapping: three subject tabs (Physics/Chemistry/Maths) → each subject contains Units/Chapters, and inside each unit are Topics. Students should be able to tick topics as they complete them, add confidence level and notes, and the page should show subject-wise completion charts plus unit-level progress bars and filters (e.g., “Not started / In progress / Done”, “Low confidence”). Progress should update instantly across the app (dashboard + analytics). Also include a Study Log section built like an interactive daily journal: the default view shows today’s log with an easy form (hours per subject, topics studied, questions solved, accuracy/quality rating, notes). Students must be able to switch days (yesterday/tomorrow via arrows or calendar picker) and revisit/edit past logs, plus a built-in Study Log Analytics view with daily/weekly/monthly graphs, subject split, consistency trend, and correlation insights (e.g., “more hours → better mock performance”).

Add a Revision Tracker that supports spaced revision and reminders: students can select a topic (preferably from syllabus topics), choose a spaced schedule pattern (prebuilt presets + custom intervals), set preferred reminder time, and generate upcoming revision sessions automatically. Include a Schedule page that looks like a simplified calendar: month/week/day views, where all auto-generated revision sessions appear, and students can also add their own events (classes, tests, targets). Alongside this, include a Tasks page (to-do system) where students add tasks, set deadlines/priority, tick off tasks, and see them reflected in the schedule. Make the entire experience gamified: streak tracking (study streak + revision streak), XP for completing logs/tasks/revisions, badges for milestones (e.g., “7-day streak”, “1000 questions”), and gentle nudges when streak is about to break.

Include a Backlog & Weak Topics tracker where students can add backlog items and weak topics (ideally selectable from syllabus), assign a reason (concept gap / practice gap / forgetting), priority, deadline, and track progress until completion; backlog completion should also contribute to XP/badges. Add a Mock Test / Test Analysis section where students enter test results (date, total score, correct/incorrect/blank, subject-wise breakdown) and optionally tag mistakes (conceptual/calculation/silly/time). The analysis should show trends over time (scores, accuracy, speed if provided), highlight weakest subjects/units/topics, and allow the student to map a test’s mistakes to specific syllabus units/topics (cross-matching), so the app can recommend which topics to revise and automatically create revision/backlog items from mistakes. The final output should be a complete product-style prompt that results in a coherent app layout, crisp UX flows, and all the above pages working together with consistent navigation, shared data updates, and a motivating student experience.
